## Overview

### The challenge

This final project is going to combine everything Iâ€™ve learned so far. I'm going to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned that you cannot use an html id that starts with a number. When you reference it using CSS and JS, it will fail.

I also had the opportunity to practice refactoring to prevent code duplication.

### Continued development

I couldn't figure out how to apply button effects when the keyboard is used.
